# List
It is a doubly linked list that uses the locality property of the Cache to speed up work.
For locality, we store all the elements in one array. There are arrays data, next and prev. 
We also create a graphical dump for more convenient testing of the program. 
The list is displayed in physical order, with arrows pointing to its logical order.
